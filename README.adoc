This is a simple wrapper for Git smart HTTP servers where users have shell
access.

On such systems, CGI scripts (such as the Git HTTP server) will often run as the
user, in order to be able to access user files and repositories, but the HTTP
server may need to access authentication data (e.g. a Kerberos keytab) that
regular users should not have access to.  This wrapper allows such systems to
run as the user with a webserver-specific group and drop privileges to the
user's default group before executing Git, which may in turn execute
user-provided hook scripts.

The script is designed to be extremely paranoid, although it does not sanitize
the environment, as the web server is expected to provide a suitable
environment.

Simply run `make` and chmod the `git-wrapper` binary 4755 root:root.  Copy it
into `/usr/local` or somewhere else suitable and invoke it instead of the normal
git-http-backend binary.
